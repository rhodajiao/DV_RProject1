For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"gplots\")\nlibrary(\"plyr\")\nlibrary(\"RCurl\")\nlibrary(\"reshape2\")\nlibrary(\"grid\")\nsource(\"../01 Data/SQLData.R\")\ndfc       \n       \n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
